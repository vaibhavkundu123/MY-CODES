INTERPOLATION_SEARCH (A, lower_bound, upper_bound, VAL)

Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET LOW = lower_bound, 
HIGH = upper_bound, POS = –1
Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 to 4 while LOW <= HIGH
Step 3: SET MID = LOW + (HIGH – LOW) × 
((VAL – A[LOW]) / (A[HIGH] – A[LOW]))
Step 4: IF VAL = A[MID]
 POS = MID 
 PRINT POS
 Go to Step 6
 ELSE IF VAL < A[MID] 
		 SET HIGH = MID – 1
 ELSE 
 SET LOW = MID + 1
 [END OF IF]
[END OF LOOP]
Step 5: IF POS = –1
 PRINT "VALUE IS NOT PRESENT IN THE ARRAY"
 [END OF IF]
Step 6: EXIT
