BINARY_SEARCH(A, lower_bound, upper_bound, VAL)

Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET BEG = lower_bound
END = upper_bound, POS=-1
Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 while BEG <= END
Step 3: SET MID = (BEG + END)/2
Step 4: IF A[MID] = VAL
SET POS = MID
PRINT POS
Go to Step 6
ELSE IF A[MID] > VAL
SET END = MID-1
ELSE
SET BEG = MID+1
[END OF IF]
[END OF LOOP]
Step 5: IF POS=-1
PRINT “VALUE IS NOT PRESENT IN THE ARRAY”
[END OF IF]
Step 6: EXIT
