Step 1: Add)to the end of the infix expression
Step 2: Push(on to the stack
Step 3: Repeat until each character in the infix notation is scanned
IF a(is encountered, push it on the stack
IF an operand (whether a digit or a character) is encountered, add it to the
postfix expression.
IF a)is encountered, then
a. Repeatedly pop from stack and add it to the postfix expression until a
( is encountered.
b. Discard the ( . That is, remove the ( from stack and do not
add it to the postfix expression
IF an operator is encountered, then
a. Repeatedly pop from stack and add each operator (popped from the stack) to the
postfix expression which has the same precedence or a higher precedence than 0
b. Push the operator to the stack
[END OF IF]
Step 4: Repeatedly pop from the stack and add it to the postfix expression until the stack is empty
Step 5: EXIT
