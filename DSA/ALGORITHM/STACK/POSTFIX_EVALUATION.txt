Step 1: Add a ")" at the end of the postfix expression
Step 2: Scan every charecter of the postfix exporession and repeat Steps 3 and 4 until ")" is encountered
Step 3: If an operand is encountered, push it on the stack
If an operator 0 is encountered, then
a. Pop the top two elements from the stack as A and B as A and B
b. Evaluate B and A, where A is the topmost element below A
c. Push the result of evaluation on the stack
[END OF IF]
Step 4: SET RESULT equal to the topmost element of the stack
Step 5: EXIT
